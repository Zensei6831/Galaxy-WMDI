For short read analysis we make use of 2 fastq.gz files acquired by an illumina machine:

- `short_read_test_S7_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz` – 160 MB
- `short_read_test_S7_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz` – 163 MB

For long read analysis we make use of 2 fastq.gz files acquired by an ONT machine:

- `long_read_test_A0085_01.fastq.gz` - 155 MB
- `long_read_test_A0085_02.fastq.gz` - 161 MB
